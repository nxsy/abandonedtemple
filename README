Abandoned Temple
----------------

Don't have a D compiler or dub?  Don't know how to build libglfw3?  Any other
issues?  Look at the bottom of this file!

One-time configure:

    LIBGLFWPATH=/path/to/libglfw3.dylib  # optional, config.sh will ask otherwise
    sh scripts/config.sh

Build && run:

    dub

Just build:

    dub build


Frequent issues:
================


My graphics card/drivers don't support OpenGL 3.3+
--------------------------------------------------

Try upgrade your graphics card drivers.  If you're running MacOS X, make sure
you are running Mavericks or later.  Otherwise, sorry, I can't help you.


How do I build libglfw3?
------------------------

Generally, get the source and follow the instructions at:

    http://www.glfw.org/download.html

If you're on Windows, you might be able to use the pre-compiled binaries there.

If you're on a Linux distribution or on a BSD with a diverse package system, it
might have binary packages or a source "port" that will help you out too.

Let me know if you succeed or fail at any of the above.
